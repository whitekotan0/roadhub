## 💡 What is this?

**Roadmap Hub** is a lightweight, open-source platform for creating, sharing, and tracking educational roadmaps. 

Unlike traditional linear lists, this tool visualizes knowledge as a **Skill Tree** (similar to video games). It helps learners understand dependencies, track their progress, and see the "big picture" of any subject—from Mathematics to Knitting.

It is **Serverless**. Everything runs in the browser. You own your data (JSON).

## ✨ Features

### 🎨 Visual Editor (No-Code)
Create complex graphs without writing a single line of code.
* **Drag & Drop:** Move nodes freely on an infinite canvas.
* **Smart Linking:** Drag from node connectors to link dependencies with beautiful Bezier curves.
* **Real-time Preview:** See your changes instantly.

### 🧭 Interactive Viewer
* **Progress Tracking:** Mark nodes as "Completed" and see your % rise. Data is saved locally.
* **Zoom & Pan:** Navigate massive roadmaps with D3.js powered controls.
* **Rich Content:** Nodes support Markdown links and descriptions.

### 🌗 Theming Engine
* **Dark Mode (Default):** "Wine & Deep Blue" palette for late-night study sessions.
* **Light Mode:** "Pastel Beige & Blue" palette for clarity.
* **Customizable:** Built with CSS Variables for easy re-skinning.

### 📂 Open Architecture
* **JSON Based:** All maps are simple JSON files. Easy to share, version control, or generate programmatically.
* **Local Loading:** Open any roadmap file directly from your computer without uploading it anywhere.
